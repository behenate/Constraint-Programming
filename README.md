This repository contains solutions for tasks from 2021/2022 Constraint Programming course on AGH UST.


Tasks include some classic optimization problems, all solved using the `MiniZinc` language. `MiniZinc` is a nice change from typical programming languages and was definitely my favourite course on the 3rd semseter.
